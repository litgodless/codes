{
SYNTAX OF A STRUCTURE
struct student{
 char name[100] ;
 int age ;
 };
 struct student s1;
 NEW THING HOW TO INPUT STRING IN THE PROGRAM IN A STRUCTURE AS THE REINITIALISATION IS BANNED IN STRINGS YOU CANNOT JUST DO
 s1.name="pratyush";
 CAUSE ACCORDING TO THE COMPILER YOU ARE REINITIALISING THE STRING VARIABLE SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS
 YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE STRING.H FILE AND 
 strcpy(s1.name,"pratyush");
 WHICH WILL DO THE WORK BUT INITAIL METHOD WILL NOT WORK
